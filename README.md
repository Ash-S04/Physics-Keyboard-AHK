# Physics/Maths symbols Keyboard
This is an Autohotkey v2 program to easily type out unicode symbols often used in mathematics and physics, such as the greek alphabet and common symbols such as ≠ (not equal to) and ∝ (proportional to).
See the ahk file for all Unicode characters and how to type them.

some commands are commented out such as capital greek letters that resemble the latin alphabet but can be reinable by removing the ; at the start of the line

Common symbols:

^ is the ctrl key

! is the alt key

+ is the shift key
